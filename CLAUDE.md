# Solo Leveling — build state

Full product spec: [docs/SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md) — read it first for any feature work.
Build order is spec Section 10; work through phases in order, testing (`./gradlew assembleDebug`) between each.

## Current phase

**Phase 1 done** (project scaffold, nav shell, dark/blue/violet theme, minimal Room schema).
Next up: **Phase 2** — Export/Backup scaffold (JSON write), per spec Section 10.

## Locked-in decisions

- Package/applicationId: `com.nightpixel.sololeveling`
- minSdk 26, targetSdk/compileSdk 35
- AGP 8.7.2, Kotlin 2.0.21, Gradle 8.9 (wrapper), Room 2.6.1 via KSP (not kapt)
- No Hilt/DI framework — manual instantiation via `SoloLevelingApplication` (single-user local app, kept deliberately simple)
- No light theme — the System-window dark aesthetic is fixed, not a user toggle
- Bottom nav screens are one file (`ui/screens/PlaceholderScreen.kt`) until each phase gives them real content
- Room schema JSON (`app/schemas/`) is committed — needed for migration tests per spec Section 3

## Build environment (this machine)

- Android SDK: `C:\Users\joshu\AndroidSdk` (cmdline-tools only, no Android Studio GUI installed)
- Portable JDK 17 at `C:\Users\joshu\AndroidSdk\jdk17\jdk-17.0.20+8`, used for all Gradle/Android tooling
- The system default JDK (Temurin 25) does NOT work for Gradle/sdkmanager on this machine — see
  the `dev-machine-jdk-tls-workaround` memory for why, before touching JDK/Gradle config here.
- `./gradlew.bat assembleDebug` works standalone (no manual env vars) once `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`
  has `org.gradle.java.home` pointing at the JDK 17 above.
- No device/emulator has been tested yet — `adb install -r` per spec Section 3 once one is available.
